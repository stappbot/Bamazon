# Bamazon

MySQL inventory creator

**What does it do?**
Bamazon pulls its data from mysql database that has been previously created in order to show the user the inventory of the available products. The user, following prompts, can select by ID which product they want and how many of that product. They will be given the total cost of their order. If there is insufficient inventory for the desired product the user will be told as much.

**Usefulness**
This application is very useful for ordering products online. It allows the customer to see the full inventory and to place orders.

**Getting Started**
Users may git clone this project and use "npm init" and "npm i" to install the needed features. Open the terminal and run "node app.js" to start the program. Follow the prompts as needed to place an order.

**Getting Help**
This is a pretty straight-forward application, but all questions are welcome and I am happy to help. Please ask for help through GitHub- username: stappbot.
